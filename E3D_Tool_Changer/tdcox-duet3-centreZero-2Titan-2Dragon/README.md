This file is for a standard E3D Tool Changer with Titan tools in docks 0 and 1, Dragon tools with tool boards in docks 2 and 3, running RepRapFirmware 3.2.0-beta4 on Duet 3.

The extruder jerk setting has not yet been optimised. Too low a setting results in slow printing when pressure advance is used. Too high a setting makes the Titan extruders noisy and may cause hot end jams.

X0 Y0 is at the centre of the bed.
